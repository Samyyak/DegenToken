# DEGEN GAMING TOKEN

This is a smart contract in the form of Token for Degen Gaming where several functionalities can be performed.

## Description

With the help of Smart Contracts, we can mint tokens, transfer them from one address to another, burn them, and buy certain Degen Gaming merchandise over the Decentralised Network. The workings of the contract are verified over the Avalanche Fuji Test Network. The verification is done on Snowtrace Testnet.

## Getting Started

### Installing

You can download the DegenToken.sol file and then compile it in Remix and then choose Environment as Injected Provider - Metamask and after that deploy the contract.

### Executing program

Steps to be followed to run the contract seamlessly:

1. First we have to take test credit in the form of AVAX tokens in the Avalanche Fuji C-Chain.

   *The following steps are to be followed to create a Test Network in Metamask:*
   *Network Name*: Avalanche Fuji C-Chain
   *New RPC URL*: https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc
   *ChainID*: 43113
   *Symbol*: AVAX
   *Explorer*: https://testnet.snowtrace.io/

2. Now we will go to the core web app to request for Tokens and there we have to enter the coupon code that we will get after we join the Get Avax for free guild.
   
3. Now we can generate the secret code and enter it in the coupon code address and after that, we will enter the address of the Account in the Test net of Avalanche.
   
4. We will get 0.5 AVAX per day and after that, we can use those to test our contract.

5. Now we will go back to Remix and then choose Environment as Injected Provider - Metamask and after that deploy the contract.

6. After that we will flatten the solidity file and then download the new file that is generated.

7. Now we will copy the address of the deployed contract and then paste it into Snowtrace Testnet and then click on verify and publish contracts.

8. Then we will click on verify, select chain as Fuji, enter the address of the new contract, and select the compiler version mentioned in the solidity file. Then, we will upload the flattened solidity file in it and click on verify.

9. After all is done we will now perform transactions in the contract and those will be logged in the Snowtrace.


## Working

After the Contract is deployed we can perform the following operations in it:

1. Minting Tokens: Creating new tokens (can only be done by the owner).
2. Burning Tokens: Burn tokens from the whole smart contract.
3. Redeem Tokens: Buy different merchandise using tokens.
4. Transfer Tokens: Transfer tokens from a particular address to another address.
5. Get Balance: Check the balance of a particular address at a particular time.
6. Store Items: Displays the list of all merchandise present in the inventory with attributes: (Name, Cost).
7. Approve: Approve a certain address to be able to transact in the smart contract environment.
8. Pause: Pause all token transfers (only by the owner).
9. Unpause: Unpause all token transfers (only by the owner).
10. Withdraw ETH: Withdraw the ETH balance to the owner's address.
11. Add Merchandise: Add new merchandise items (only by the owner).
12. Get Merchandise List: Retrieve the list of all merchandiseÂ items.

## Help

Certain errors may occur while verification of the contract for that we have to keep in mind that the solidity version specified in the contract, the version in the solidity compiler, and the one chosen while verifying should be the same.

Apart from it we also have to flatten the file because the JSON format has to be adaptable as normal import statements are not compatible with the verification portal.
